1. Components overview
    * Split UI into independent and reusable pieces
    * Think about isolation
    * React let you define components as:
    - Functions components (pref to use them) 
    - Classe components (starts with class componenets but nowadays func components are standart!)
2. Functional components
    * Accepts single argument called ( props (object with data)).
    * 
3. Props is short for properties
    * Are received from above(parent)
    * Immutable
4. State Hook
    * useState (only for functional components) The class compenent killer :D
